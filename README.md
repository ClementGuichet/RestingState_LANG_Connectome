<h1 align="center">RestingState_LANG_Connectome</h1>

Method Overview

- Preprocessing of resting-state data using SPM12
- Relying on 6mm-264-regions from Power atlas (Power et al., 2011)
- Connectivity matrices obtained via CONN Toolbox processing
- Graph-theory measures with GraphVar and BCT Toolbox on the previously defined 131 ROIs of the LANG Connectome (Roger et al., 2022)

Features

- Original methodology for accurate RSN assignment (with voxel-level precision) to ROIs 
- New functional hub classification according to nodal centrality and information flow
(i.e., degree, Participation coefficient, Within-module_z-score, Betweenness centrality, Flow coefficient)
- Individualized hub detection procedure
- Data-driven approach for Age (Wald Hierarchical clustering) and Gender-related effects
- New topologico-functional profile visualization and their n-way interactions with Age, Gender, Resting-state-networks, Community structure
